My name is José María Landa Chávez. I'm currently an Applied Math undergrad at [Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana Unidad Cuajimalpa](http://www.cua.uam.mx/). 

This blog is a presentation of the interesting topics and solutions I come across in my day to day as a math/programming enthusiast, and an exploration of the deeper mathematical ideas therein.

I have a particular interest in blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and functional programming languages.

Here are some of the languages you can excpect to see being used in the blog:

1. [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

2. [Java](https://www.java.com/)

3. [Python](https://www.python.org/)

4. [Forth](https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/)
