The history of mathematics is to an astonishing degree the history of calculus. The calculus was the first great achievement of mathematics since the Greeks and it dominated mathematical exploration for centuries.

In the beginning there were two calculi, the **differential** and the **integral**. The first had been developed to determine the slopes of tangents to curves, the second to determine the areas of certain regions bounded by curves. 

## Newton and Leibniz

The general idea of calculus, its fundamental theorem, and its first applications to the outstanding problems of mathematics and the natural sciences are due independently to Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716).

The methods developed by these two men solved the same class of problems and proved many of the same theorems yet were based on fundamentally different theories. 

Newton thought in terms of limits whileas Leibniz though in terms of infinitesimals, and although Newton's theory  was formalized long before Leibniz's, it is far easier to work with Leibniz's methods. 

Leibniz's work as formalized by **Abraham Robinson** in 1961 under the name of **nonstandard analysis**.

## The Infinitesimals

This approach to calculus involves **expanding the real number system** by introducing new numbers called **infinitesimals**.

These new numbers will have the property that although different from zero, each is smaller than every positive real number and larger than every negative real number. 

## Nonstandard analysis

Suppose we wantd to find the slope of the tangent to $$y=x^2$$ at the point $$(1,1)$$

How can we approach this problem without the notion of limites?

We know how to find the slope of a line given two points of said line, but here we are only given one point $$(1,1)$$ plus the information that the line is tangent to $$y=x^2$$ at that point.

1. Let $$\odot$$ denote a positive infinitesimal.

2. Consider two points of the curve $$y=x^2$$ which are infinitely close to one another, (1,1) and $(1,(1+\odot)^2)$
